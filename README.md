## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was not aware that there was a video tutorial with help on how to create a tip calculator. I made one myself at first, which was a challenge, but I learned a lot. 
I also had issues since the video is pretty recent but still somewhat outdated. However, I was able to solve those situations by looking online for solutions. Since I was not too familiar with the syntax in swift, I had to learn it first. So, I learned the major concepts of Swift such as Optionals and general syntax.
This was a very fun project. I feel like I am going to learn a lot.
